        <h1>Home Is Where The Heart Is.</h1>
        <p> The lifestyle of a competitive surfer sounds pretty incredible on the surface.
They get to travel to some of the most sought after destinations, chasing waves and surfing  iconic and uncrowded waves all while experiencing the local culture and everything on offer. Until you discover they spend the better part of their year on the road (or in the air) away from loved ones and most importantly, the comforts of home.

Team rider Bianca Buitendag has been travelling since she was 14, and for her there’s no place like home. Read about how Bianca feels about the anticipation of life on the road and the constant pull of home here -


I have noticed a small change of heart, or is it home? The excitement and urgency of coming home seems to subside a little more every time I cross the seas.
Travelling since the age 14 sets you up for a slightly different lifestyle to those around you.  </p>

        <h2> 18 Hours To Baja </h2>
        <p> As far as road trips go, this one is a bona fide rite of passage.

Road tripping through Baja is an adventure into the unknown with the promise of less crowded waves just waiting to be claimed.

Travelling south on Highway 1, with no real time frame or final destination in mind, we drove from sundown to sun up and arrived at paradise along the Sea of Cortez. </p>

			<h3>#ROXYREADY FOR COACHELLA GIVEAWAY  </h3>
			<p> It’s that time of year again – when we shake off the winter blues, pack up the car and pick up our friends for a road trip to our favorite music festivals! With the sun coming out, and an epic festival almost every other weekend, we're getting set for Southern California’s Coachella coming up in a few weeks.
 
Rocking that perfect festival style is key and with our new Spring collection it's almost too easy. Assembling your festival outfits is all about keeping  cool in the sun with light dresses and breezy rompers, paired with versatile layering pieces, large totes and comfortable, cute sandals.

			<h3>Roxy Outdoor Fitness </h3>
			<p> It’s your time to shine! From first to last light, be ready to run with our new favorite style of the season.
 
 
In the Get Glowing vest, you’re sure to shine with ultra-bright reflective stretch silver jersey. Soft-on-the-skin comfort comes in the form of stretch knit panels that allow for maximum movement and a feminine fit. The vest includes a zip-up front and a zip-up stow pocket on the back, ideal for stashing keys & on-the-go snacks.
 
 
We tracked down professional surfer Rosy Hodge to find out that her running routine also includes night running, which she does during dark winter nights as well as during the summer to escape the heat of the hot summer sun.
 
 
In chillier conditions, we like to pair our Get Glowing vest with the Keep Moving or No Limits running tops.  Dusk and darkness are now no excuse to skip your run in the Get Glowing vest! </p>

			<h3>Stay Restless. Stay Curious. Embrace The Unknown </h3>
			<p>It’s born inside all of us. Wanderlust. That feeling. That pull. That restless tickle in our feet, always whispering "Keep it moving." That rush of adrenaline that gets us out of bed, and out of our comfort zones. Sending us out to climb waves and mountains alike. In search of the next ride. The next thrill. The next evolutions of us. Bowing at the altar of “Yes.” And embracing the unknown with open arms. Both in the world, and in ourselves. Always wandering. Always wondering. Always open to whatever comes next. Shedding old skins for new. While seeking peace in madness and zen in the middle of a storm. Where foreign becomes familiar, and being a stranger isn't strange at all.  Because home is a mindset.  And getting lost is where you get found.
